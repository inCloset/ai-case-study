# TITLE: Case Study of Upstart 

## Overview and Origin
### The Company and the Brand
The traditional lending method to determine a borrower's financial strength to repay their loan is broken, unjust, and at times unfair. Specifically customer of lower income, people of color, and migrants are vastly impacted by these methods which financial institutes leverage to access customer likely not to defult on their loan. 

Upstart, founded in 2012 by three ex-Google, Anna Counselman, Dave Girouard, and Paul Gu emabarked on the journey to disrupt and challenge the norm of accessing customer financial background or FICO score. 
        
Upstart is primarily funded through a partnership with banks and credit unions, where these institutions provide the capital to fund loans originated on the Upstart platform; for lower-risk borrowers, partner banks often hold these loans on their balance sheet, while for higher-risk borrowers, the loans are typically sold to institutional investors after origination by the bank partners; essentially, Upstart acts as a marketplace connecting borrowers with lenders, generating revenue through fees on the loans facilitated through their platform

## Business Activities
### Dilemma and The Solution
Traditional lending models quantify the risk of a portfolio of loans based on criteria such as average credit score, income, and debt ratio. These estimates are commonly done at the portfolio level, rather than at the loan level. This approach can produce a useful, but imprecise, prediction of the loss rate for a portfolio.

More modern risk models quantify the unique risks of default and prepayment for each loan in the portfolio.

We connect millions of consumers to 100+ banks and credit unions who leverage Upstart’s artificial intelligence models and cloud applications to deliver superior credit products. Our platform includes personal loans, automotive retail and refinance loans, home equity lines of credit, and small dollar “relief” loans. Focusing on assessing creditworthiness beyond traditional credit scores.

### Target Market
The target market of Upstart is as follows, however lets point out that at the time of the case, the market share that Upstart commands in the Lending Partners landdscape was unknown
1. Personal Loan Borrowers - market size of about $300B
2. Lending Partners - Banks, Credit Union etc

### Core Business Model vs Competitors
It starts by vastly expanding the information used to inform a credit decision. Our sophisticated machine learning algorithms tease out relationships between more than 1,600 variables2. Trained on more than 77 million repayment events, our AI system learns and improves on its own.

With an average of 80,9781 new repayments due each business day across all our lending partners, our models optimize in response to daily loan-level repayment and delinquency data.

As a result, our proprietary and patented loan-month model can predict the likelihood of default or prepayment for each month of a loan term for every applicant.

### Product and Services
|Product       |Product Description |
|:------------:|        :-----:     |
|AI Lending Marketplace      |A platform that connects consumers with banks and credit unions using AI models to offer credit products like personal loans, auto loans, and home equity lines of credit.  |
|Personal Loans        | Loans provided to individuals for personal use, facilitated through Upstart's AI-driven platform.  |
|Automotive Retail and Refinance Loans    |Loans for purchasing or refinancing vehicles, offered through Upstart's AI platform.  | 
|Home Equity Lines of Credit|Credit lines secured by the borrower's home equity, available through Upstart's AI platform.|
|Small Dollar 'Relief' Loans|Short-term loans for small amounts, designed to provide financial relief, available through Upstart's platform.|
|Upstart Macro Index (UMI)|A tool that helps lending partners understand the impact of macroeconomic conditions on credit performance.|

### Technology Stack         
The Upstart Macro Index (UMI) estimates the impact of the macroeconomy on credit losses for Upstart-powered unsecured personal loans. UMI is expressed as a multiple of defaults relative to a static baseline due to macroeconomic changes. For example, a UMI of 1.25 for a given month suggests that the macro caused default rates to be 25% higher than the long-run average.

Additinal technology stacks leveraged at Upstart are as follows
1. Programming Languages:

        Python: Likely used for machine learning models, data analytics, and backend development.

        UMI is enabled by Upstart’s unique risk models that estimate likelihoods of default and prepayment for each month of every Upstart-powered loan. We refer to this as our patented loan-month model. This unique risk model allows us to more accurately separate applicant risk from macro risk—and to measure the macro risk more rapidly.
