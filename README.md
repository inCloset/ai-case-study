# TITLE: Case Study of Upstart 

## Overview and Origin

* Name of company - Upstart

* When was the company incorporated? 2012

* Who are the founders of the company? ex-Google Anna Counselman, Dave Girouard and Paul Gu

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?

        Traditional lending models quantify the risk of a portfolio of loans based on criteria such as average credit score, income, and debt ratio. These estimates are commonly done at the portfolio level, rather than at the loan level. This approach can produce a useful, but imprecise, prediction of the loss rate for a portfolio.

        More modern risk models quantify the unique risks of default and prepayment for each loan in the portfolio.

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?

## Business Activities

* What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve? 

        We connect millions of consumers to 100+ banks and credit unions who leverage Upstart’s artificial intelligence models and cloud applications to deliver superior credit products. Our platform includes personal loans, automotive retail and refinance loans, home equity lines of credit, and small dollar “relief” loans. Focusing on assessing creditworthiness beyond traditional credit scores.

* Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?

        1. Personal Loan Borrowers - market size of about $300B
        2. Lending Partners - Banks, Credit Union etc
        

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

        It starts by vastly expanding the information used to inform a credit decision. Our sophisticated machine learning algorithms tease out relationships between more than 1,600 variables2. Trained on more than 77 million repayment events, our AI system learns and improves on its own.
        With an average of 80,9781 new repayments due each business day across all our lending partners, our models optimize in response to daily loan-level repayment and delinquency data.
        As a result, our proprietary and patented loan-month model can predict the likelihood of default or prepayment for each month of a loan term for every applicant.



* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing&mdash;you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)
                
        The Upstart Macro Index (UMI) estimates the impact of the macroeconomy on credit losses for Upstart-powered unsecured personal loans. UMI is expressed as a multiple of defaults relative to a static baseline due to macroeconomic changes. For example, a UMI of 1.25 for a given month suggests that the macro caused default rates to be 25% higher than the long-run average.

## Landscape

* What field is the company in?

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this field over the last 5&ndash;10 years?

* What are the other major companies in this field?

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?

        UMI is enabled by Upstart’s unique risk models that estimate likelihoods of default and prepayment for each month of every Upstart-powered loan. We refer to this as our patented loan-month model. This unique risk model allows us to more accurately separate applicant risk from macro risk—and to measure the macro risk more rapidly.

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this field use to measure success? How is your company performing based on these metrics?

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same field?

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
